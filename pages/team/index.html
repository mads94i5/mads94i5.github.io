    <h3 class="gradient-text">OVERVIEW</h3>
    <p>I am a solo developer and I began learning Unity/C# and started development 
        in October 2018 as a spare time hobby. In August 2022, 
        I registered the company in anticipation of getting on Steam.
        <br><br>
        The name of the company has a dual meaning. Firstly, 'swalk' is the gaming 
        nickname I have gone by since the age of 13. Secondly, it is also something that 
        used to be written on the back of letters in the format: S.W.A.L.K. and it means; 
        sealed with a loving kiss. This goes hand-in-hand with the fact that I am creating a work of passion.
        <br><br>
        I would love to expand the company and work with others, but it requires some 
        form of financial success as this is a near zero-budget venture. My business model 
        is; "don't spend something you don't have".

            <p>Previously worked ten years as a bricklayer in the construction business, 
                but for health reasons I had to make a change of directions in life. 
                I had self-learned coding in mSL (mIRC Scripting Language) at the age of 14, 
                where I customized my IRC client and made a simple
                <a href="https://github.com/mads94i5/mIRC-matchmaking" target="_blank">matchmaking bot</a> 
                before matchmaking was a standard feature in video games.
                I participated in a Game Maker project in the 2010s, 
                and then I picked up Unity/C# in 2018. Now I am studying Computer Science at KEA (Copenhagen) 
                and will finish my new education in the summer of 2024.
                <br><br>
                I have been playing video games since I was very young. I've been playing 
                everything from Commodore, to Amiga, MS-DOS, Nintendo, Sega, PlayStation, 
                Xbox, PC and the list goes on. In games, I greatly value good gameplay, 
                challenge level and great controls over many other things.
                <br><br>
                I'm also a bit of a music enthusiast and I've played guitar as a hobby now for years, 
                but I got into keys in conjunction with making the music for Legends of Mythology. 
                I have been going to concerts and music festivals regularily since 2008 and I'm 
                <a href="https://pastebin.com/8nRJjGc8" target="_blank">quite a nerd about it</a>.
