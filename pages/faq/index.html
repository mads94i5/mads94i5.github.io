    <h3 class="gradient-text">FAQ</h3>
    <h5>WHY ISN'T LEGENDS OF MYTHOLOGY ON X AND Y PLATFORMS?</h5>
    <p>I would love to bring the game to all platforms, but to start off with I am targetting Steam. The game has no budget behind it and thus, I have to do one at a time.</p>
        <br>
    <h5>HOW LONG IS THE DEMO?</h5>
    <p>First time playtests by players have run between 20 minutes to over 1 hour.</p>
        <br>
    <h5>WILL THERE BE A PHYSICAL RELEASE?</h5>
    <p>Not of the demo. But I would love to make a physical release of the final game, but it requires a certain amount of financial success to be viable.</p>
        <br>
    <h5>WHERE CAN I FIND THE SOUNDTRACK?</h5>
    <p>The soundtrack will be included with the final product, along being available at my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@swalkstudios" target="_blank">Youtube</a> as possibly other platforms. So no soundtrack until then.</p>
        <br>
    <h5>WHEN IS THE EMBARGO?</h5>
    <p>The embargo is the same as the launch date/time, that way players can try the game themselves when they discover it. <br>
    Please respect this for the sake of the players as well as other people covering the game.</p>
        <br>
    <h5>HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE 'SWALK'?</h5>
    <p>Simply the same as the word; 'walk' - but with a leading 's'.</p>
        <br>
    <h5>SHOULDN'T 'SWALK' BE CAPITALIZED?</h5>
    <p>No, because I don't write my nickname that way. So it is written non-capitalized.</p>
        <br>
    <h5>WHAT GAMES INSPIRED YOU?</h5>
    <p>I have far too many inspirations to list them all, but to name a few:<br>
    1976 Adventure, Castlevania series, Zelda II and the Dark Souls series.
    </p>
        <br>
    <h5>WILL THE GAME BE TRANSLATED TO X AND Y LANGUAGE?</h5>
    <p>I would love to have the game translated to as many languages as possible.<br>
    However, with no budget behind the game, I don't have the option to hire translators and will have to rely on community effort.<br>
    For such efforts, I distribute the game with the Localization.csv file, so anyone can freely add a language and send it to me.
